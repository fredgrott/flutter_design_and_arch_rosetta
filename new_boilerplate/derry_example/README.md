![about me](./media/about-me-header.jpg)

My journey is creating a maker and creator studio by bootstrapping through teaching developers and designers how to develop dart and flutter applications. My premise in front-end app creation is that we, as developers and creators, are not creating code, graphics, and the experience but instead teaching humans how to learn about that task they want to do.

That journey we invite the app-user on with our app is a journey that works backward from inside the use to outside the user. Make an impact on the user's inner life, and then 100% of what you want to teach automatically becomes taught. This new premise came from my journey in getting my ADHD under control.

Part of my teaching process is also to out-loud introduce you to the meta-conversation that every successful developer and designer has in their head when they confront new challenges and produce solutions.
