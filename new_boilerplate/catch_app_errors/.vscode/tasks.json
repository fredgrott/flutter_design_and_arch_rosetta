{ // Created 3-2021 Fredrick Allan Grott
  // Note: Not using compounds on the emulator and simulators yet as I do not have enough 
  //       laptop ram but whoever is forking and modifying this can figure out how to add it.
  //       Keeping things similar to Android Studio setup as these repos are being used 
  //       to teach flutter app development using android studio and vscode.
  //       I use emulator plugins to handle starting emulators and simulators.
  //
  //       Also, note that some of this stuff is platformOS specifc. Take it and modify according 
  //       to your platformOS shell specifics.
