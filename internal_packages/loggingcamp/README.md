# Logging Camp

Internal Logging tools

## How To Use

 HOW TO USE:

 In the main function

 ```dart

 main(){
  appInitLog()
 }
 ```

 

Then to log already defined levels it's

```dart
 appLogger.info(message);
 ```

To get log areas for screen widgets use the UILoggerMixin and the myNewLogger or the myDetachedLogger
