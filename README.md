## About Me, Fred Grott

I am on a different adventure of creating a Maker and Creator studio startup, the bootstrap way
in teaching Flutter Application Design and Development to you guys and gals. 

The idea for the studio, is some will be creative in the front end apps created; and some of it will 
be maker with some iOT stuff and some embedded stuff. Along with the DIY IT-infrastructure stuff such as 
video-NAS, a app-build-NAS, and a flutter build server with some front-end target child build servers.

My keybase profile is at: https://keybase.io/fredgrott

My current set-up is an Asus x750j, MS Windows 10(I actually prefer Linux and MacOSX, too bad LiteSetp is no-longer maintained so that I could switch MS Windows Shell to fully customize the Desktop Screen-UI into something better), one LCD on TVHD screen, and starving for a decent Apple mini so I can get a decent wacom-drawing-tablet as my laptop is 
so old that it only has usb-A ports.

Tool-wise its, for graphics its Krita and  Inkscape. For IDE dev stuff it's MS Windows Terminal, VSCode(Insiders Edition), and MS Powershell. Book publishing wise it's markdown and some tool-chain to build the pdfs and ebook files and git.
