## The Gist

Developing and designing a front-end flutter application demands that you know what the application is supposed to do or accomplish. And, everyone answers with the problem being solved and misses the full whole idea of Human User-Interface design in the first place.

The job-of-the-application is to Teach Humans! We are not creating this program to solve a problem but to teach humans about that problem! And, when teaching humans it's the act of forming relationships that forms the best effective communication through story-telling.

This is not a story about me or a story about YOU. This is a story of a community forming around that quest of becoming a flutter expert in 1000 hours. A tale of destiny; yours and mine.

## What Will Be Found Here

You will find a Rosetta composed of some foundation of skills and best practices exploring flutter app architecture, flutter devops, flutter design, an exploration of how to teach humans to teach themselves, and how to evolve the front-end application to self learn.
